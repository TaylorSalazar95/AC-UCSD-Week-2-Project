Our project consists of one main and one class. The Game class features five methods and an initializer, 
each method featuring one function of the game. Main is the driver of the program and features multiple 
calls to the methods in the Game class. Inside the main class, there are multiple print statements, each 
representing the different stages of the hangman game. Another crucial part of the main class is to determine 
whether the user wins the round or not. Once the win condition is met, the main while loop terminates 
and ends the program. Inside the game class, there are multiple methods that run the input to see 
whether or not the word or letter is correct. A while loop was present in the game class to detect 
the amount of attempts left for the user.
